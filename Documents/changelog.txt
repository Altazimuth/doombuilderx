DoomBuilder X
based on code by CodeImp, MaxED, boris_i, ZZYZX

doom builder 2 patch, "Doombuilder X" <-tentative name (?)
- new config file named builderx.cfg located in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Doom Builder folder. it will attempt to copy your old builder.cfg on the first launch if the new file is missing.
- fixed choppiness in 3d mode if computer has been on too long
- a basic EE-UDMF config partially based on the GZDB-BF one (thanks Altazimuth, Maxed, Printz, Zzyzx). on mouseover highlights portals like line/sector tags, and includes the new sector scroller properties.
- hold alt while drawing geometry for "pen mode" (try it and you'll see)
- moved the inefficient texture categorization for texture browser into background loading thread. you should be able to actually move around and do stuff while loading a wad with a lot of textures sooner now. the textures will take the same total time to actually load in as before though. ideally i'd replace this code completely, as threading it is just sort of moving the problem.
- new hotkey added to allow you to test your map with a player start at the mouse cursor (you need to assign it in preferences) 
- some minor stuff to allow some gzdb plugin cross-compatibility (Sound Propagation, sound environ, automap). this is unstable, use at your own risk. some gzdb features are "faked" to the plugins to trick them into running
- not really a change, but just in case it's unclear, the GZDoom Editing plugin that can render slopes and 3d floors is included. may need setup in preferences
- added autogenerated "flats" & "textures" categories if you load in a config that can mix flats/textures
- missing textures are drawn with full brightness in 3d visual mode
- scripts editor opens SCRIPTS tab by default instead of DIALOGUE
- linedef edit window resizeable, shifted around a little so UDMF stuff doesn't require scrolling on default size
- sector/line/thing action special selection dropdown is larger. less scrolling
- action special selection window resizeable, is larger by default. less scrolling
- thing edit window resizeable, taller by default (equal to default linedef edit window height). less scrolling
- sector edit window resizeable
- vertex edit window resizeable, does not show up in taskbar (matching behavior of other windows)
- statusbar 18 pix shorter (less wasted space)
- map format selection dropdown taller, to not require scrolling
- error log does not show up in taskbar (matching behavior of other windows)
- on the error log window, the "close" button is highlighted by default, letting you close it by hitting enter
- texture browser opens faster, and draws faster for smoother scrolling. mild tradeoff: currently selected item is shown with a solid background, instead of a gradient
- flats in texture browser have a * after
- distant stuff in 3d visual mode is no longer obscured by fog. objects beyond the draw distance will "pop in", which may be mildly uglier, but more functional, as you get more draw distance with the same perfomance this way.
- new-map dialogue window filled in with "MAP01" by default
- configuration parser is faster -> program startup is faster
- remood, doom legacy, and jdoom cfgs disabled (less clutter, improves loading times). to re-enable them, move them from '\Configurations\old' to '\Configurations'.
- saving wad files with lumps in them unrelated to the current map should be around ~twice as fast
- logging is moved into its own thread, improving performance. should particularly help ppl with slower hard drives.
- significant speedups when drawing new geometry with a lot of vertices
- other misc performance improvements
- i've been having some issues compiling the visplane explorer plugin, so that isn't included for now :/
- newer version of zdoom ACC included
- fixed several crashes
- support for default values for some types of arguments to lines in game cfg files. same syntax as gzdb
- new game cfg linedef action setting "highlightmatchinglineid", used for EE-UDMF type 301 Line_QuickPortal
- changed titlebar text
- zokumbsp included
- default textures changed to CRATOP1 / CRATE1 / CRATOP2
- removed reject editor plugin because it's been causing crashes :/
- more explicit error if there are no plugins found
- removed system.xml and trackbar dependencies
- new error / crashlog handler
- actions can disregard the alt key (don't worry about it if you don't get it)
- Allow Eternity .pke files to be used as resources (thanks to Altazimuth)

also included are these commits to the SVN version that aren't in the build on the db2 site, these are by codeimp and boris_i
- Added Reject Editor plugin
- Upgraded project files to Visual Studio 2013
- Removed some unused code from UniversalMapSetIO
- Added plugin event OnMapNodesRebuilt which allows plugins to read/modify nodebuilder output.
- Added RebuildNodes method in MapManager which allows plugins to rebuild the nodes on demand.
@ Added NodesViewer source code
- The "Skulltag" sourceport renamed, so changed description to "Zandronium" [sic]. We can't change the filenames without giving everyone double configurations when they download an update.
- Stuck thing error checker now also regards thing flags, For more Information see [anotak edit: link removed bc the doom builder forums are gone]
- Find and Replace Mode: can now find things by their flags
- Set a proper title for the linedef flags form
- Find and Replace Mode: can now find linedefs by their flags
- @Fixed VisplaneExplorer plugin output path
- @Changed platform of VisplaneExplorer plugin from Any CPU to x86 so that it can be compiled with MSBuild
- Better timing clock without accuracy loss after long system uptime (should solve camera movement lag issues) [ANOTAK EDIT: this wasnt quite working right in that version, but it should be fixed]
- Fixed hanging things position in GZDoom Visual Mode.
- Improved stuck thing error checker: now takes vertical position of things into account (where applicable)
- Improved Hexen configuration: defined several thing properties more precisely
- Improved Heretic configuration: defined several thing properties more precisely
