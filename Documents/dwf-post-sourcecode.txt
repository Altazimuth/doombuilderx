Doom Builder X is a map editor forked from CodeImp's Doom Builder 2 by me (Anotak). [url=https://github.com/anotak/doombuilderx/]More credits here[/url].

changelog for version here 2.1.3.0 (from last db2)
[spoiler]
- new config file named builderx.cfg located in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Doom Builder folder. it will attempt to copy your old builder.cfg on the first launch if the new file is missing.
- fixed choppiness in 3d mode if computer has been on too long
- you can set your own default textures, and even have them randomize on New Map. default textures changed to CRATOP1 / CRATE1 / CRATOP2
- a basic EE-UDMF config partially based on the GZDB-BF one (thanks Altazimuth, Maxed, Printz, Zzyzx). on mouseover highlights portals like line/sector tags, and includes the new sector scroller properties.
- hold alt while drawing geometry for "pen mode" (try it and you'll see)
- new hotkey added to allow you to test your map with a player start at the mouse cursor (you need to assign it in preferences) 
- some minor stuff to allow some gzdb plugin cross-compatibility (Sound Propagation, sound environ, automap). this is unstable, use at your own risk. some gzdb features are "faked" to the plugins to trick them into running
- fixed one of the issues that causes it so that you cant click in 3d mode sometimes. lmk if this persists
- not really a change, but just in case it's unclear, the GZDoom Editing plugin that can render slopes and 3d floors is included. may need setup in preferences
- added autogenerated "flats" & "textures" categories if you load in a config that can mix flats/textures
- missing textures are drawn with full brightness in 3d visual mode
- scripts editor opens SCRIPTS tab by default instead of DIALOGUE
- linedef edit window resizeable, shifted around a little so UDMF stuff doesn't require scrolling on default size
- sector/line/thing action special selection dropdown is larger. less scrolling
- action special selection window resizeable, is larger by default. less scrolling
- thing edit window resizeable, taller by default (equal to default linedef edit window height). less scrolling
- sector edit window resizeable
- vertex edit window resizeable, does not show up in taskbar (matching behavior of other windows)
- statusbar 18 pix shorter (less wasted space)
- map format selection dropdown taller, to not require scrolling
- error log does not show up in taskbar (matching behavior of other windows)
- on the error log window, the "close" button is highlighted by default, letting you close it by hitting enter
- texture browser opens faster, and draws faster for smoother scrolling. mild tradeoff: currently selected item is shown with a solid background, instead of a gradient
- texture categorization much faster (~3500% speedup on my machine). should be noticeably faster to open a level or to reload resources
- flats in texture browser have a * after
- curve linedefs window has a "snap to grid" option. careful about this, sometimes the grid makes it not-so-curvy
- Allow Eternity .pke files to be used as resources (thanks to Altazimuth)
- zip operations are done using sharpcompress instead of sharpzip. pk3/pke loading is wayyy faster. improvements in undo/prefab speeds too. uses some code from MaxED's gzdb
- distant stuff in 3d visual mode is no longer obscured by fog. objects beyond the draw distance will "pop in", which may be mildly uglier, but more functional, as you get more draw distance with the same perfomance this way.
- new-map dialogue window filled in with "MAP01" by default
- configuration parser is faster -> program startup is faster
- remood, doom legacy, and jdoom cfgs disabled (less clutter, improves loading times). to re-enable them, move them from '\Configurations\old' to '\Configurations'.
- saving wad files with lumps in them unrelated to the current map should be around ~twice as fast
- logging is moved into its own thread, improving performance. should particularly help ppl with slower hard drives.
- significant speedups when drawing new geometry with a lot of vertices
- other misc performance improvements
- i've been having some issues compiling the visplane explorer plugin, so that isn't included for now :/
- newer version of zdoom ACC included
- fixed several crashes
- support for default values for some types of arguments to lines in game cfg files. same syntax as gzdb
- new game cfg linedef action setting "highlightmatchinglineid", used for EE-UDMF type 301 Line_QuickPortal
- changed titlebar text
- zokumbsp included
- removed reject editor plugin because it's been causing crashes :/
- more explicit error if there are no plugins found
- removed system.xml and trackbar dependencies
- new error / crashlog handler
- actions can disregard the alt key (don't worry about it if you don't get it)[/spoiler]
